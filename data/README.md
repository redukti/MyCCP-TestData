The zerocurves-testdata.txt was generated by bootstrapping zero curves from the raw data. The curves were
bootstrapped using linear interpolation. The curve id 1 is the EONIA curve and id 2 is the EURIBOR curve. The maturities 
for both curves were aligned so that the curves may used to generate VaR scenarios.
